# TicTacToe
A simple and very popular 3x3 grid board game written in Swift.  
This project can be deployed to all the iPhone seriese since iPhone 6.  
Using the constrain feature in Xcode made it possible.

**Planning to support three different game modes:**  
1. **You VS Lynn**: Lynn is a simple AI that plays TIC TAC TOE with a user.
2. **You VS Friend**: Tow people can play Tic Tac Toe together on one iPhone.
3. **You VS World**: Tow people can play Tic Tac Toe on two seperate phones.

## Getting Started
To test out this game on your device, please follow the instruction below carefully.

### Requirement
* Since this project is not fully completed, this is not released on App store.
* However, you can still run this project on your laptop by using **XCODE**.
* You can download **XCODE** from the App store.

## Development Phase
* Again this project is not completed yet and it is also on **hold** from developing phase.  
  I have designed all the game aseets and the UI design myself, but after few weeks later,  
  I start to **dislike the design concept**, so I am currently working on other projects untill  
  I come out with a better idea.
* However, most important part in this project would be **the winner checking algorithm** and  
  thankfully it is **already implemented in the game**. Therefore, if anybody wants to have an idea  
  on how to make TicTacToe game algorithm, this project will still be very helpful.  
  **checkWinner() function** is the algorithm and you can find it from **Mode2 Class**.
